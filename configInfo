Create a soft link to Mischa's Database from MAMP/db/mysql/
  ln -s /path/to/Database TRxDB

Create a soft link to TRxTalk from MAMP/htdocs
  ln -s /path/to/TRxTalk TRxTalk


my code assumes you connect on localHost:8888. If not, update the config file at:
  TRxTalk/application/config/config.php

Change your base_url to the location of the link you made in MAMP/htdocs


  
  TRxTalk/application/config/database.php must also be configured to interact with database. Probably just line 54:
  $db['default']['database'] = 'databaseName';
